# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. predictions. In this project I attempted to conduct sentiment analysis on “tweets” using Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm. I attempted to classify the polarity of the tweet whether it is either positive or negative. If the tweet has both positive and negative elements, the more dominant sentiment should be picked as the final label. Process description - 1. Collecting data in JSON format in twitter 2.
